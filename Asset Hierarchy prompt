## Final prompt for process industries (copy/paste)

> You are an industrial ERP/EAM asset architect for **process industries** (continuous + batch plants).
> I need a **scalable asset hierarchy** that supports:
>
> * work orders, notifications, PM plans, job plans
> * maintenance history and failure analysis (reliability)
> * criticality ranking, safety/environment flags, compliance tracking
> * spare parts/materials linkage
> * cost roll-up by site/area/unit/system and also by cost center
> * **clear separation between fixed installation locations (“where it is”) and replaceable/movable maintainable items (“what it is”)** so history is not lost when equipment is replaced.
>
> My current draft is: **Enterprise → Location → Plant → Unit → Subunit → Equipment**.
> Improve this into a **best-practice process plant model** that avoids mixing geography, org/finance, and physical maintenance structure.
>
> **Context (assume typical process plant unless I override):**
>
> * Assets include: rotating equipment (pumps/compressors), static equipment (vessels/columns/exchangers), packaged skids, piping systems, instruments/valves, electrical assets, utilities/offsites.
> * Some equipment gets replaced/swapped; locations are fixed.
> * There may be parallel trains and common utilities.
>
> **Deliverables (use this exact structure):**
>
> 1. **Recommended backbone hierarchy** for the physical/maintenance view
>
>    * list each level (e.g., enterprise/site/plant/area/unit/system/location/equipment/component)
>    * give a simple definition of each level and when to use it
> 2. **Org/finance structure vs physical structure**
>
>    * propose a clean way to represent cost centers/ownership without adding messy hierarchy levels
> 3. **Rules for “Location/Slot” vs “Maintainable Equipment”**
>
>    * how replacement works (history retention)
>    * how movement works (equipment history follows the item)
>    * how packages/skids are handled
> 4. **Naming + ID conventions**
>
>    * code pattern (stable, sortable, short)
>    * examples for: (a) a pump, (b) an exchanger, (c) a control valve or instrument loop, (d) a packaged compressor skid
> 5. **Minimum data fields** (must-have) per level
>
>    * include: criticality, discipline, safety flag, status, install date, manufacturer/model/serial (where relevant), cost center link
> 6. **Common pitfalls** in process industries and how your design prevents them
> 7. **Worked example**
>
>    * show one complete chain from enterprise → … → location → equipment → components for a realistic process area asset.
>
> **Acceptance tests (your design must satisfy):**
>
> * If a pump is replaced, I keep the failure and work history tied to the **installation location**.
> * If a spare pump is moved to another location, its OEM/repair history stays with the **equipment item**.
> * I can report cost and downtime by **site / plant / area / unit / system** *and* by **cost center** without duplicating hierarchy levels.
> * The model supports process units *and* utilities/offsites cleanly.
> * The naming scheme stays stable even if service names change.
>
> Keep it practical and implementation-ready. Avoid vendor-specific terms.

Here’s a **SAGD-specific v1 standard prompt** you can copy/paste. It’s tailored to **2 CPFs, 10 wellpads, 8 well pairs per pad**,
and it forces a clean hierarchy that works for maintenance + reliability + cost rollups, without vendor terms.

## SAGD asset hierarchy prompt (v1 standard)

> You are an industrial ERP/EAM asset architect specializing in **SAGD facilities**.
> Design a **scalable asset hierarchy** and naming standard for a SAGD operation with:
>
> * **2 Central Processing Facilities (CPF-1, CPF-2)**
> * **10 wellpads (WP-01 … WP-10)**
> * Each wellpad has **8 well pairs** (injector + producer) = **WP-xx / Pair 01..08**
>
> The hierarchy must support:
>
> * work orders, PM plans, job plans, notifications
> * maintenance & failure history, reliability analysis, criticality
> * cost rollups by site/CPF/wellpad/unit/system and also by cost center
> * spares/material linkage
> * **clear separation between fixed installation locations (“where it is installed”) and replaceable equipment (“the maintainable item”)** so history is not lost when equipment is replaced/swapped
> * support for both **CPF process units** and **field/pad assets** (wells, pipelines, pad utilities, instruments, power, communications)
>
> **Important SAGD modeling needs:**
>
> * Represent **wellpairs** as a structured set (Injector + Producer) with shared pad infrastructure
> * Include flow paths: wellpair → pad production gathering → trunkline → CPF inlet → separation/treating → export/disposal
> * Support packaged skids (chemical injection, metering skids, instrument air packages, etc.)
> * Allow parallel trains in the CPF (if present) without breaking reporting
>
> **Deliverables (use this exact structure):**
>
> 1. **Recommended backbone hierarchy** for the *physical/maintenance view*
>
>    * Define each level and when to use it (e.g., enterprise → site → facility → area → unit → system → location/slot → equipment → component)
>    * Show how you represent: CPF-1, CPF-2, wellpads, wellpairs, wells, trunklines, and pipelines
> 2. **Org/finance vs physical structure**
>
>    * Propose how cost centers/ownership are linked without adding messy hierarchy levels
> 3. **Rules for Location/Slot vs Equipment**
>
>    * Replacement rules (location keeps history; equipment item carries its own history)
>    * Movement rules (how swapped pumps/valves/meters are treated)
>    * Rules for skids/packages and rented/temporary equipment
> 4. **Naming + ID convention (stable, sortable, short codes)**
>
>    * Provide a code pattern for each level
>    * Provide examples for these SAGD items:
>      a) A **wellpair** (Injector + Producer) and each well’s key equipment
>      b) A **pad production header / manifold** and **test separator** (if any)
>      c) A **trunkline / gathering pipeline segment** from WP-03 to CPF-1
>      d) A **CPF inlet separator** and a **produced water pump**
>      e) A **control valve** and a **flowmeter** (instrument assets)
> 5. **Minimum master data fields** per level (must-have)
>
>    * include: criticality, discipline, safety/environment flag, status, install date, manufacturer/model/serial (where relevant), parent links, cost center link
> 6. **Common SAGD pitfalls** and how your design prevents them
>
>    * examples: mixing geography with process hierarchy, inconsistent pad naming, not separating wells vs pad infrastructure, losing history on replacements, pipeline segmentation problems
> 7. **Worked example**
>
>    * Show one full chain from enterprise → site → CPF/wellpad → … → location → equipment → components
>    * Use **WP-03 Pair-05** and include at least: the producer well, pad manifold, a chemical injection pump, the gathering line segment, and the CPF inlet equipment.
>
> **Acceptance tests (must satisfy):**
>
> * If a pump at WP-03 is replaced, the **pad location** retains failure/work history.
> * If a spare pump is moved from WP-01 to WP-03, the **equipment item history** moves with it.
> * I can report downtime/cost by **CPF**, by **wellpad**, by **wellpair**, and by **system**.
> * Pipelines can be tracked in a way that supports inspection and maintenance history by segment.
> * The naming scheme stays stable if service names or operating modes change.
>
> Keep it practical and implementation-ready. Avoid vendor-specific terms.

### Optional add-on (only if you want tighter output)

Add this line at the end if you want it even more “ERP-ready”:

> Also output a small table mapping each asset type to: `level`, `is_location_slot?`, `is_equipment?`, `typical PM owner discipline`, and `typical criticality method`.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **ready-made SAGD hierarchy template** (a concrete tree with sample IDs for CPF-1/CPF-2, WP-01..10, Pair-01..08) that you can paste straight into your ERP/EAM master data build sheet.
