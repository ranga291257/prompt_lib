Here are prompts that work well analyzing tables in a pgsqldatabase kind of work:
1. Be specific about scope
“Analyze only the tbl_* tables from the mineassist migration.”
“Focus on turnaround and asset tables; ignore refinery/variable tables.”
2. Say what you want as output
“Give me a short summary and a prioritized list of changes.”
“Produce a markdown report I can share with the team.”
“Only suggest FKs; don’t suggest type changes.”
3. Clarify constraints
“We can’t change column types yet; only suggest indexes and FKs.”
“Suggest improvements but no breaking changes to existing app code.”
4. Call out the database and tools
“Analyze the apmcai Postgres schema…”
“Use the same DATABASE_URL / scripts we use in this repo.”
5. One clear ask per request
“List all tables and row counts.”
“Find every place asset_id could be a foreign key and to which table.”
Example “next time” prompt you could use:
“Analyze the apmcai Postgres database: list tables and row counts, suggest primary keys and indexes (no schema changes), and list possible foreign key relationships between tables. Output a markdown report in docs/.”
That gives scope (dbname), tasks (PKs, indexes, FKs, no DDL changes), and format (markdown in docs/).
